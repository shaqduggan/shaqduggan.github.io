                        <p>With a population that will reach close to 10 billion by 2050, there is a real need for sustainably source foods.Peanuts are a protein-packed, nutritious, plant-based food and are essential to the growing movement to help the planet by eating more plants. This will have to meet the food supply and nutrition demands of the future.

                  <p>Eighty-five percent of the earth's water supply of fresh water today goes to agriculture. Peanuts have a relatively small water footprint and is a water efficient, nutrient and energy dense crop.

                  <p>Contributions by the American peanut industry go to growers in Haiti, Ghana and elsewhere. These contributions bring benefits to those populations and researchers here at home. Peanuts are the 12th most valuable cash crop grown in the United States with a farm value of over one billion U.S. dollars, according to The American Peanut Council.

                            <p> Peanut butter is a paste that is made with dry roasted peanuts. You can have up to 100% peanut content, according to the need or the manufacturer. They don’t contain artificial sweeteners, colors or preservatives, although some manufacturers may add salt, sugar or oil to stabilize the mixture.</p>
                            <p> The early 1900s peanuts became a significant agricultural crop when the boll weevil threatened the South’s cotton crop. Following the suggestions of noted scientist Dr. George Washington Carver, peanuts served as an effective commercial crop and, for a time, rivaled the position of cotton in the South.</p>

                            <p>This flour is a good alternative for people with celiac disease (gluten allergy) and vegans. Peanut flour has a widespread use in the food industry for its pleasant taste and aroma. It is used to prepare snacks, which are baked like French fries, and also to enrich smoothies and thicken sauces.</p>
                            <p>This peanut by-product is used to fry, sauté, or add flavor. Peanut oil can be used at high temperatures and has a high smoke point. In addition, the food that’s cooked in it doesn’t absorb its flavor.</p>

                            <p>Corn, okra, Brussels sprouts, and sunflowers are ideal for Vertical towers but crops such as peanuts can be adapted to be profitable at scale.</p>

                    <h1>Peanut Allergy Study</h1>
                    <p>The LEAP-On study is an extension of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study. LEAP showed that regular peanut consumption begun in infancy and continued until 5 years of age led to an 81 percent reduction in development of peanut allergy in infants deemed at high risk because they already had severe eczema, egg allergy or both. At the end of LEAP, participants who enrolled in LEAP-On were instructed to avoid peanut consumption for one year to help investigators determine whether continuous peanut consumption is required to maintain protection against development of peanut allergy. After the avoidance period, peanut allergy prevalence was determined, as it was in LEAP, by an oral food challenge.  Only 4.8 percent of the children who had regularly consumed peanut-containing foods during LEAP were allergic to peanut following the year of peanut avoidance. In comparison, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 18.6 percent among those who had avoided peanut throughout LEAP and LEAP-On.</p>
                    <p>“These new results build on the landmark findings from the LEAP study, which was the first to show that early introduction of peanut can prevent the development of allergy to it,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “They demonstrate that regular consumption of peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy induces peanut tolerance that persists following a year of avoidance, suggesting the lasting benefits of early-life consumption for infants at high risk of developing peanut allergy.”</p>
