            <p class="card-text">Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to a turtle. With its aerodynamic shape and grooved surface, Squirtle's shell helps it wade through the water very quickly. It also offers protection in battle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal. </p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Wartortle</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Wartortle is a small, bipedal, turtle-like Pokémon with a similar appearance to that of its pre-evolved form, Squirtle. Some differences are that Wartortle have developed sharper and larger claws and teeth, and that their tails are larger and fluffier than those of Squirtle's. The fur on Wartortle's tail darkens with age. Wartortle have developed large furry ears. Like its pre-evolved form, it can also use its shell to protect itself. Its shell bears the scratches of many battles.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Blastoise are large, tortoise-like Pokémon with some features similar to those of its pre-evolved forms. Blastoise has a large blue body, cream-colored stomach, small fat arms and legs, and a large brown shell rimmed with white, featuring its water cannons. It is now noticeably bulkier than its previous evolutions. Like its pre-evolved forms, Blastoise has a shell which covers its entire body, which it can also be withdrawn into. Contrary to Squirtle and Wartortle, Blastoise has large, water cannons that are located on the top left and right sides. The water that comes out of the cannons is capable of punching holes through thick steel.</p>
